               A visualization of Lewontin's Paradox of Variation. This
               combines pairwise diversity estimates from Leffler et al.

               (2014) with census popoulation sizes I've estimated using
               inferred range sizes and population densities estimated using
               macroecological scaling relationships. The gray ribbon

               $1\times10^{-8}-1\times10^{-9}$. The gray dashed line is the
               ordinary least squares estimate, and the blue dashed line is the

             the signal of such rapid phenotypic shifts in genomic data, and understanding
             how it impacts genetic variation in the genome.

           <aside> <sup>1</sup>A trait, or phenotype is said to be
             <em>polygenic</em> when more than one one gene (and anywhere from
             tens to thousands of genes) affect the trait's value. Numerous
             polygenic traits impact fitness, such as body size in animals or
             flowering time in plants.  </aside>
 
           <p>During my PhD, I became fascinated by the problem of detecting
           rapid polygenic<sup>1</sup> adaptation. We have seen extensive
           examples of rapid polygenic adaptation in natural populations, where
           over short "ecological" timescales a population's trait average
           changes due to an environmental change or other stimulus. However,
           detecting such adaptation at a genomic level is challenging, since
           the effects of selection are distributed across all of the many
           sites contributing to the trait, and the subtle allele frequency
           changes can be mistaken for random genetic drift. This leaves us in
           an unfortunate place: while ecologists and evolutionary biologists
           can observe rapid phenotypic changes in natural populations,
           detecting these adaptive events in genomic data that is now widely
           available is incredibly difficult. Yet, we need to understand how
           rapid phenotypic adaptation affects genome-wide variation to have a
             complete view of how evolution is working in populations.
             <strong>Connecting evolutionary quantitative genetics with
               population genomic data is a central theme in my
               research.</strong></p>

           <p> In my PhD work, Graham Coop and I show that temporal genomic
           data (allele frequencies sampled from a population over many
           generations) provides a way to detect polygenic adaptation over very
           short timescales. The signal we use is that a neutral allele (i.e.
           an allele that does not directly affect fitness) behaves differently
           through time when selection is present. In particular, the
           allele frequency changes each generation (e.g. \(\Delta p_0 = p_1 -
           p_0, \Delta p_1 = p_2 - p_0, \) etc.) under drift are
           independent, and consequently the covariance between allele
           frequency changes (e.g. \(\text{cov}(\Delta p_t, \Delta p_s)\)) is expected to be
           zero. However, when heritable fitness variation exists in the
           population, this creates covariances in allele frequency changes
           that we can directly measure from genomic data. We call this
           <strong>temporal autocovariance</strong>. In our <em>Genetics</em> paper, <em><a
             href="https://www.genetics.org/content/213/3/1007">The Linked
             Selection Signature of Rapid Adaptation in Temporal Genomic
             Data</a></em> we work out
           mathematical expressions for its strength and show how we can
           estimate additive genetic variance for fitness using measured levels 
           of temporal autocovariance.</p>

           <figure>
             <img src="/images/sim-pred-covs-varyl-alt.png" width="700" class="img-responsive"/>
             <figcaption>

               Simulation results (points) show that our mathematical
               expressions for temporal autocovariance (lines) match closely.
               Additionally, the level of temporal autocovariance is a function
               of the total additive genetic variance in a region, and is
               invariant with respect to the number of loci (different colors).
               Since we currently lack mathematical models of the additive
               variance through time, we have used the different measures of
               this variation over time from the simulations to predict the
               level of temporal autocovariance (these are the different
               lines); more detail can be found in our manuscript.

           </figure>
 
           
           <p>In addition to allowing us to detect polygenic adaptation from
           temporal genomic data, temporal autocovariance also allows us to
           address a long standing issue in evolutionary genetics: how can we
           quantify the effects of selection and drift on genome-wide allele
           frequency changes? This is a long-standing problem in evolutionary
           genetics, going back to the vitriolic debates between R.A. Fisher
           and Sewall Wright in the 1940s. For the first time, we can directly
           partition how much of the variance in allele frequency change is
           directly caused by linked selection. In our <em>Genetics</em> paper,
           we have developed an estimator, <strong>G</strong>, which quantifies
           the proportion of the total variance in allele frequency change that
           is due to linked selection<sup>2</sup>.
           </p>
           <aside><sup>2</sup> 
             This is defined as the sum of the covariances terms (only non-zero in
             the presence of linked selection) divided by the total variance:
             \[G = \frac{\sum_{i \ne j} \text{cov}(\Delta p_i, \Delta p_j)}{\text{Var}(p_t - p_0)}\]
           </aside>

           <p> In a second paper, published in <a
             href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/08/07/1919039117/">PNAS</a>,
             we apply these ideas to three published temporal genomic datasets.
            
             We find extensive evidence in three studies that
             linked selection effects genome-wide allele frequencies over short
             timescales. Overall we estimate that at least 17% to 37% of allele
             frequency change is driven by selection in these experiments
             (using our measure <strong>G</strong> mentioned earlier). Results
             from a reanalysis of one of these studies is shown below: 
           </p>

            <figure>
             <img src="/images/figure-1.png" width="700" class="img-responsive"/>
  
             <figcaption>
               In one study we re-analyzed, <a
                 href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000128">Barghi
                 et al. (2019)</a>, 
               
               we find that temporal autocovariances decay through time as our
               theory predicts (due to the effect of decreasing associated
               fitness variation and recombination shuffling genetic
               backgrounds), shown here in Figure A, which plots the rows of
               the temporal variance-covariance matrix (shown on the right). In
               Figure B, we show our measure <strong>G</strong>,
               the cumulative effects of linked selection on the proportion of total 
               variation due to linked selection (schematic shown on bottom right).
           </figure>

           <p>Finally, we also find evidence of reversals in the direction of
           selection in the Barghi et al. (2019) data, indicated by negative
           temporal covariances over long periods of time. A huge benefit of our 
           approach is that we can tease out a signal of these more complicated 
           selection dynamics with genome-wide data that may not be evident by 
           analyzing individual allele frequency trajectories.
           </p>
          <p>

          Overall, this work begins to address two long-standing problems in
          evolutionary biology: how can we detect polygenic adaptation over
          short timescales, and how can we quantify the effects of drift versus
          selection on genome-wide variation? As more temporal datasets
          continue to be created, we can also begin to reconcile our short-term
          estimates of the genome-wide impact of selection with estimates of
          how selection shapes genomic diversity over longer periods, from
          single contemporaneous samples. Furthermore, I hope to quantify the
          extent to which fluctuating selection acting over short timescales
          are occurring in natural populations, and the impact they have on
          genetic variation.  </p>

             During summer 2015, Graham, <a
               href="http://www.clfs.umd.edu/labs/mount/">Steve Mount</a>, and
             I worked out a set of probability distributions that model the
             number of blocks and their lengths one shares with an <a
               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome">X
               chromosome</a> ancestor $k$ generations back in the past.
             Additionally, we modelled the number and lengths blocks one shares
             with a present-day relative on the X chromosome. As ancestry
             services like <a href="https://www.23andme.com/">23andme</a> and
             <a href="http://www.ancestry.com/">ancestry.com</a> use identical
             by descent blocks<sup>1</sup> between individuals to infer shared
             ancestry, Graham and I were curious how much information about
             ancestry is in X chromosomes and what these block distributions
             look like.  </p> <aside><sup>1</sup>A stretch of DNA that that
             derived from a common ancestor without being broken by
             recombination or changed via mutation is <strong>identical by

             descent, see <a

           <p>Since the heterogametic sex only has <em>one</em> X ancestor
             (e.g. in humans, males have only one X ancestor in the previous
             generation — their mother), one's number of X ancestors $k$
             generations back is curiously enough the $(k+2)^\text{th}$ <a
               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci
               number</a>. Additionally, X chromosomes only undergo meiotic
             recombination in females, so the distribution of recombinational
             meioses varies depending on the lineage to a particular ancestor.
             This leads to some neat combinatorics that we use in our
             derivation of our distributions.</p>

           <p>
             Most species live in spatially structured populations, connected
             through a complex demographic history of population movements and
             splits, migrations, expansions, and declines. The demography of
             populations both reflects and impacts processes on evolutionary
             time scales (e.g. speciation, local adaptation, gene flow) and
             ecological timescales (e.g. competition, disease spread,
             predation). Population genomic methods (Novembre et al., 2008; Li
             and Durbin, 2011) seek to infer these demographic and
             geographic histories.
           </p>

           <p>
             
             However, I see current methods as having two limitations: (1) they
             are unable to reconstruct recent demographic and migratory events
             over the past tens to hundreds of generations, and (2) these
             methods are not well positioned to utilize the hundreds to
             thousands of individuals currently being sequenced and genotyped. 
           </p>

           <p>

            Graham and I are currently looking into how to tackle this problem
            by summarizing pairwise coalescent time distributions across each
            pair in a sample, and then summarizing these coalescent times
            across various time slices (e.g. 0-10, 11-30 generations, etc).
            Over all pairs of individuals we obtain a matrix of the number of
            shared common ancestors for each time period, which captures
            individuals’ relatedness in particular time slices. However, each
            matrix is likely to be sparse (contain many zero entries), due to
            noise in coalescent time estimation — which we're tackling with
            statistical approaches that smooth across adjacent time slices and
            across individuals.</p>
